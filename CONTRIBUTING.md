# Contributing to AgentGate

Thanks for your interest in improving AgentGate! Contributions of all kinds are
welcome — bug reports, docs fixes, tests, and features.

## Getting set up

Requirements: **Node.js >= 22** (and [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh) only if
you touch the smart contracts — `forge`, `cast`, `anvil`).

> Foundry is not optional for the full test run: `packages/chain`'s live-client
> suites spawn a real `anvil` and deploy the contracts to it, so without the
> toolchain those 35 tests fail rather than skip.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agentgate-0g/0g-gate.git
cd AgentGate
npm install
npm run demo        # one-shot offline demo — should exit 0
```

The repo is an npm workspace monorepo:

- `packages/*` — TypeScript packages (middleware, chain client, CLI, SDK, buyer agent, shared)
- `dashboard/` — Next.js dashboard
- `contracts-evm/` — the Solidity contracts (registry, PaymentRouter, SpendGuard) deployed on 0G Galileo Testnet

## Before you open a PR

Run the full local verification:

```bash
npm test            # vitest suite (unit + e2e loop)
npm run typecheck   # all workspaces + root
```

If you changed a contract, also run its tests:

```bash
cd contracts-evm && forge test    # 77 tests across the five suites
```

See `contracts-evm/README.md` for the Foundry setup and the deploy procedure.

## Pull request flow

1. Fork and create a topic branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused; add or update tests for behavior changes.
3. Make sure CI is green (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs tests + typecheck).
4. Open a PR against `main` and fill in the PR template.

## Reporting bugs & requesting features

Use the issue templates. For security vulnerabilities, **do not open a public
issue** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Docs

Architecture and protocol details live in `docs/` (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SPEC.md`).
The live deployment details (contract addresses, sample transactions) are in
the README's "Deployed addresses" section.
